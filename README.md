**Welcome to SPLIT | ELITE KAMRUL**

Thank you for choosing SPLIT, an efficient tool for splitting large files into smaller segments. Follow the steps below to utilize the full potential of SPLIT.

### Step 1: Launch SPLIT

Run the SPLIT program by executing the appropriate command or by double-clicking on the executable file.

```
SPLIT.exe
```

### Step 2: Enter Target Size

When prompted, enter the desired target size for each split segment in megabytes. For example:

```
Enter the target size in megabytes: 100
```

This will instruct SPLIT to divide the file into segments, each approximately 100 megabytes in size.

### Step 3: Provide File Path

Next, input the full file path of the file you wish to split. Ensure the file is located at the specified path. Example:

```
Enter the file path: "D:\XAMPP\htdocs\test\ip\DATA FILE\500.txt"
```

Make sure to include the quotes around the file path, especially if it contains spaces.

### Step 4: Specify Output Folder

Now, enter the destination folder where you want the split segments to be saved. Example:

```
Enter the output folder: "D:\XAMPP\htdocs\test\ip\DATA FILE\output"
```

Again, use quotes around the output folder path if it contains spaces.

### Step 5: Process Completion

Once you've provided all the required information, SPLIT will start processing the file. Sit back and wait for the process to complete.
